  Really one command!
  1. Press Windows key and R at the same time
  2. Type ```powershell irm https://usefulstuffs.github.io/ByeByeEdge-OneCMD/powershell | iex``` on the run box (don't irm blindly, [audit the script](https://github.com/usefulstuffs/ByeByeEdge-OneCMD/blob/main/powershell) before running the command, I'm not doing anything bad!)
  3. Press enter and wait for the script to finish (UAC prompt might appear, click yes)
